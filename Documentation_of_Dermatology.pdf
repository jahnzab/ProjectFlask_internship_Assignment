Abstract:
This project presents a deep learning-based approach to classify dermatology diseases using the EfficientNetV2-S model. The model was trained on a dataset of 15,557 training images and 4,002 test images across 23 dermatological classes. The objective was to achieve accurate automatic classification to assist dermatologists in diagnostic processes.
