 Project Title

Multimodal Psychometric Mental Health Assessment System (Anxiety, Depression, Stress)

---

1. Overview

This project builds a **machine learning–based system** to classify **anxiety, depression, and stress levels** using questionnaire data collected from psychometric instruments:

* GAD-7 for Anxiety
* PHQ-9 for Depression
* PSS for Stress

It processes numerical survey responses (0–4 Likert scale) to predict categorical labels such as *“Mild Anxiety”*, *“Severe Depression”*, and *“Moderate Stress.”*

The model uses **Random Forest Classifiers** with **scikit-learn**, ensuring interpretability, fast inference, and reliable results on CPU hardware.

2. Data Sources

| Dataset    | File             | Description                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Anxiety    | `Anxiety.csv`    | Based on **GAD-7 questionnaire**             |
| Depression | `Depression.csv` | Based on **PHQ-9 questionnaire**             |
| Stress     | `Stress.csv`     | Based on **Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)** |

Each dataset contains both raw responses (0–4) and computed labels such as *Low*, *Moderate*, *Severe* levels.

3. Data Correction and Preprocessing

3.1 Stress Data Correction

The PSS questionnaire contains **reverse-scored questions (4,5,7,8)**.
The script automatically:

* Reverses scores (`4 - value`)
* Recalculates total PSS scores
* Assigns corrected labels:

  * ≤13 → *Low Stress*
  * 14–26 → *Moderate Stress*
  * ≥27 → *High Perceived Stress*

A verification step prints the first 10 corrected rows to confirm label accuracy.

3.2 Unified Dataset Creation

After correction:

 All three datasets are merged into a **combined dataframe** with 26 features (questions).
 A new column `condition_type` identifies whether a record belongs to Anxiety, Depression, or Stress.

---

Questionnaires

Anxiety (7 Questions – GAD-7)

Focuses on nervousness, restlessness, and fear.

Depression (9 Questions – PHQ-9)

Measures loss of interest, hopelessness, tiredness, and negative thoughts.

Stress (10 Questions – PSS)

Assesses perceived control, irritability, and workload coping ability.

Total features used = **26 questions**

---

5. Label Encoding & Feature Scaling

* Label Encoding: Converts textual class labels (e.g., “Moderate Anxiety”) into numerical codes.
* Standard Scaling: Normalizes responses for each condition separately using `StandardScaler` to improve model stability.

Each condition (anxiety, depression, stress) has its **own scaler** and **label encoder** saved for deployment.

---

6. Model Training

Each mental health dimension is trained **independently** using:

* Model: `RandomForestClassifier`
* Hyperparameters:

  * `n_estimators=100`
  * `max_depth=15`
  * `class_weight='balanced'`
  * `n_jobs=-1` (CPU parallelism)
* Split: `train_test_split` with 80% training, 20% testing
* Hardware: CPU-only mode (GPU explicitly disabled)

The script trains and saves **three models:**

1. Anxiety Model
2. Depression Model
3. Stress Model

7. Evaluation Metrics

7.1 Anxiety Model (GAD-7)

* Accuracy:** 94.07%
* Classes:** Minimal, Mild, Moderate, Severe Anxiety
* Insights:** Performs exceptionally well for moderate and severe categories.

 7.2 Depression Model (PHQ-9)

* Accuracy:** 88.18%
* Classes:** Minimal, Mild, Moderate, Moderately Severe, Severe Depression
* Insights:** Excellent separation between moderate and severe states.

7.3 Stress Model (PSS)

* Accuracy:** 93.35%
* Classes:** Low, Moderate, High Stress
* Insights:** Slight underperformance for low stress due to fewer samples.

All reports include **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**, and **Confusion Matrices** saved in `results.txt`.

8. Artifacts Saved

| File                                    | Description                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mental_health_models_26_questions.pkl` | Contains all trained models, scalers, and encoders       |
| `question_info_26_questions.pkl`        | Stores question text, mapping, and scoring info          |
| `anxiety_questions.pkl`                 | List of 7 GAD-7 question texts                           |
| `depression_questions.pkl`              | List of 9 PHQ-9 question texts                           |
| `stress_questions.pkl`                  | List of 10 PSS question texts                            |
| `results.txt`                           | Full evaluation logs with metrics and confusion matrices |

These are used later by the Flask web app for prediction and interaction.

9. Prediction Pipeline

The test pipeline:

1. Loads model artifacts from disk
2. Generates a simulated 26-question input
3. Splits into 7+9+10 question subsets per condition
4. Applies the respective scaler
5. Predicts label using Random Forest
6. Decodes label via the corresponding encoder

Example Output:

```
Anxiety → Moderate Anxiety
Depression → Severe Depression
Stress → Moderate Stress
```

10. Flask App Integration

The Flask backend will:

* Load all `.pkl` artifacts
* Ask user psychometric questions interactively (doctor-like chat style)
* Use **Gemini embeddings** to interpret free-text answers
* Generate advice (e.g., breathing, mindfulness, counseling recommendations)
* Display results for each condition with score levels

---

 11. Key Advantages

 Uses real psychological scales (clinically validated)
 Modular and interpretable model architecture
 CPU-friendly training and inference
 Saved artifacts ready for production API
 Achieved >90% accuracy across all conditions

---

12. Next Steps

* Integrate **Gemini API** to handle conversational input and semantic embeddings.
* Build a **Flask-based Question-Answer interface** to simulate mental health screening.
* Extend to a **multimodal system** (voice tone, facial emotion recognition).
